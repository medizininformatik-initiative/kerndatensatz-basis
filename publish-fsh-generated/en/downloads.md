#### Package File

The following package file includes an NPM package file used by many of the FHIR tools. It contains all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages and URLs in the IG, etc., defined as part of this version of the Implementation Guide. This file **SHOULD** be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since it contains all the rules about what makes the profiles valid. Implementers must still be familiar with the specification content and profiles that apply to create a conformant implementation. See the [validating profiles and resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/validation.html) documentation in FHIR for more information.
