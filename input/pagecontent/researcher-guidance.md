### Guidance for Researchers

{:.bg-warning}
**Note:** Detailed guidance for researchers will be added in a future version of this implementation guide.

#### Getting Started

If you are new to the MII Core Dataset, we recommend exploring the following resources:

**1. Logical Models - Understanding Module Content**

The [Logical Models](logical-models.html) provide high-level, technology-independent descriptions of what data is included in each module:

* **Person Module** - Demographics, vital status, and patient identifiers
* **Diagnosis Module** - Clinical diagnoses and related information
* **Procedure Module** - Medical procedures and interventions
* **Treatment Case Module** - Encounters and episodes of care

These models help you understand the scope and structure of available data without needing to understand FHIR technical details.

**2. UML Diagrams - Visualizing Data Relationships**

The [UML Diagrams](uml-diagrams.html) show how different data elements relate to each other within and across modules. These diagrams are particularly useful for:

* Understanding data interrelations
* Identifying relevant data elements for a research question

**3. Examples - Seeing FHIR Data in Practice**

The [Examples](examples.html) section provides samples of FHIR resources that demonstrate:

* How clinical data is represented in FHIR format
* What a complete dataset looks like
* How different resources reference each other

Reviewing examples can help you understand what to expect when working with MII Core Dataset implementations.
